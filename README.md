While I would also like a radical change – simplification – I guess that
might not be wanted, also because of "brand recognition".


Now, the missing sizes are there, space should be better utilized in
all resolutions, contrast is enhanced and colors pop more, therefore I
find it to be much more recognizable in the Dock.
